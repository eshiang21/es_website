## <font color='2a7ae2'>About</font>
I am a first-year masters student at [Data Science Institute](https://www.datascience.columbia.edu/) of [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). I recently completed my bachelor's degree in statistics from [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu/) this June.

### **Bootstrap and Time Series Analysis on Global Temperature Data** 
*The goal was to investigate research into the supposed "climate hiatus" of 1998-2013. I constructed ARIMA models and a command line script performing circular block bootstrap analysis on GISTEMP and HadCRUT global surface temperature anomaly data. Methodology was borrowed from the research paper found [here](https://statistics.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj6031/f/2015-16.pdf).*

### **Parkinson's Disease Classifier with Acoustic Speech Features** 
*The goal was to develop a statistical model that could use dysphonia measures to replicate speech experts' assessment of future rehabilitation treatment status. I constructed a neural network classifier that utilized principal component analysis and resilient backpropagation with weight tracking. Final model performed with 94% test accuracy.*

### **Spotify Chart Webscraping, Exploration, and Analysis** 
*The goal was to examine any striking phenomena that occurred during December 2018 streaming counts of the U.S. Top 200 Daily Chart. I constructed a web scraper and leveraged calculations as well as data visualizations to substantiate my assertions.*
