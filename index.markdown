## <font color='2a7ae2'>About</font>
I am currently a masters student at the [Data Science Institute](https://www.datascience.columbia.edu/) of [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/). Previously, I completed my bachelor's degree in statistics from [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu/). 

I am actively seeking summer 2021 internship opportunities. My interests lie with leveraging statistically-grounded methods to address questions in marketing, business, and product analytics.

### **Descriptive and Predictive Analytics on Uniqlo Shirts** 
*The goal was to investigate characteristics of the eBay marketplace on Uniqlo shirts during the summer of 2020 through interactive visuals as well as statistical methods. I constructed a web scraper, designed a dashboard, and built regression models.*

### **Time Series Analysis of Global Temperature Data** 
*The goal was to explore research into the supposed "climate hiatus" of 1998-2013. I constructed ARIMA models and a command line script performing circular block bootstrap analysis on GISTEMP and HadCRUT global surface temperature anomaly data. Methodology was borrowed from the research paper found [here](https://statistics.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj6031/f/2015-16.pdf).*

### **Machine Learning Applications on Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Rehab Treatment** 
*The goal was to construct a statistical model that could use dysphonia measures to replicate speech experts' assessment of future rehabilitation treatment status. I built a neural network classifier that utilized principal component analysis and resilient backpropagation with weight tracking. Final model performed with 94% test accuracy.*

### **Exploratory Data Analysis for Spotify Streaming Charts** 
*The goal was to examine any striking phenomena that occurred for December 2018 streaming counts of the U.S. Top 200 Daily Chart. I constructed a web scraper and leveraged calculations as well as data visualizations.*
